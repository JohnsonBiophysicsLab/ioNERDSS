## io_nerdss

This repository primarily contains Python code for creating user-friendly analysis tools for setting up models and analyzing output from the reaction-diffusion simulator NERDSS.

### Branch description

We have created a new development branch where we will be improving the code quality, cleaning up tutorials, optimizing certain functions, and reorganizing directories for better readability.

### Folder Descriptions

**IoNERDSSPyPi: Holds the main code of the library + extra files necessary for PyPi**
 - **IoNERDSS:** Holds the actual code. Each function can be find as a seperate file in /functions.
 - **ioNERDSS.egg-info:** text that is necessary for PyPi.

**Tutorial: Holds developer and user tutorials**
 - **DevelopersGuide:** Describes how to edit library, and then upload it to PyPi.
 - **MultiSpeciesTutorial:** Desribes how to create graphs and spreadsheets from a multi-component histogram file outputted by NERDSS.
    - **Dodecahedron:** What is input into a NERDSS sim.
    - JupyterNotebook: Describes how to use different functions required for making graphs and spreadsheets from the output of a multi-component NERDSS sim.
    - histogram_complexes_time_dode_1 .... _5: the output from a NERDSS sim used by IoNERDSS in this context.
    - .png / .csv: Charts and spreadsheets outputted by IoNERDSS.
 - **ReadRealPDBTutorial:** Describes how to interpret a pdb file from a database & create NERDSS inputs based off of it.
    - JupyterNotebook: Describes how to use different functions required for interpreting data in pbd file & how to create new inputs for the NERDSS sim.
    - 1si4.pdb (hemoglobin protein) & 1utc.pdb (clathrin protein): The .pdb files from the protein database used by IoNERDSS in this context.
    - .mol / .inp: What is inputted into a NERDSS sim, generated by IoNERDS.
    - show_structure.pdb: 'Simplified' .pdb file for creating graphs of the protein's connections, generated by IoNERDSS.
 - **SingleSpeciesTutorial:** Describes how to create inputs for a NERDSS sim & how to create graphs and spreadsheets from a single-component histogram file outputted by NERDSS.
    - JupyterNotebook: Describes how to use different functions required to create inputs for a NERDSS sim & to make graphs and spreadsheets from the single-component NERDSS output.
    - .mol / parm.inp: What is inputted into a Single-component NERDSS sim, generated by IoNERDSS.
    - histogran_complexes_time_dode_1 ... _5: The output from a NERDSS sim used by IoNERDSS in this context.
    - transition_matrix_time_1 ... _5: The output from a NERDSS sim used by IoNERDSS in this context.
    - restart.dat / 9999999.pdb: The output from a NERDSS sim used by IoNERDSS in this context.
    - output_file: IoNERDSS outputted file. Edited version of restart.dat/9999999.pdb.

**ExamplesIoNERDSS: Holds a lot of files that (i may be wrong) seem to be environments for using IoNERDSS or examples of it being used.**

### Install

To install via pip, use the command: 
pip install ioNERDSS

### Syncing PyPi from GitHub

- Navigate to the ioNERDSSPyPi folder
- Ensure that your package's version number in setup.py matches the version number of the PyPI package you want to sync (It should be a newer version). If not, update the version number.
- Create a source distribution of your package by running the following command in your terminal: **python setup.py sdist**. This will create a dist directory containing a tarball of your package's source code.
- Upload the source distribution to PyPI by running the following command: twine upload dist/*

### Best practices

- Use docstrings to document your code. Sphinx can extract docstrings from your code to create documentation, so it's important to write clear and concise docstrings that describe the purpose and functionality of your code.
- Use reStructuredText (reST) markup in your docstrings.
- Follow the Google-style docstring conventions. This is a popular convention for writing docstrings that is widely used in the Python community. It consists of a one-line summary, followed by a more detailed description, and optional sections for parameters, returns, and other details. You can find more information on this convention in the Sphinx documentation.
- Organize your code into modules and packages.
- Use meaningful names for modules, classes, functions, and variables.
- Include examples and usage instructions in documentation. Sphinx can include examples and usage instructions in your documentation, which can help users understand how to use your code.
- Use Sphinx to generate documentation.
- Add tests for each function using unittest.
