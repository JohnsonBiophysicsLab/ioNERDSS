**ExamplesIoNERDSS: Holds a lot of files that (i may be wrong) seem to be environments for using IoNERDSS or examples of it being used.** (This section has been less thoroughly checked and written about.)
 - **LocatePositionByPdbRestart** : an example of using IoNERDSS to interpret data from the pdb / restart / .dat files from a single-species NERDSS sim.
    - **PDB:** Example of using parms.inp + 9999999.pdb to locate positions.
    - **restart:** Example of using restart.dat + 9999999.pdb to locate positions.
    - Both Include:
        - output_file.pdb: File outputted by the jupyter notebook code.
 - **OutputVis:** An example of IoNERDSS using histograms and transition matricies from Single & MultiSpecies NERDSS sims to create graphs. (code not in a directory is for single species).
     - **multi_components:** Same thing but for multispecies.
        - **simulation:** Seems to be a complete NERDSS output.
        - **multi_components_sikao:** Another example of creating graphs (same data type as before, but new files).
        - JupyterNotebook: Shows a lot of examples of creating graphs based on data. Both inports and instantiates (some) functions.
        - histogram_complexes_time ... _5: NERDSS outputs.
    - histogram_complexes_time_dode_1 ... _5: NERDSS single-species output.
    - transition_matrix_time ... _5: NERDSS single-species output.
    - JupyterNotebook: Seems to just instantiate all functions that would be necessary, but does not do anything with them. Possibly intended for user to use final box?
    - hist_3d_time.py: Python script that generates a graph based on the other files in the folder.
    - multi_comp_hist.dat / hist_to_df.csv: Unknown.
 - **PdbAngleCalculation:** An example of IoNERDSS using pbd files from a NERDSS sims to create graphs and new inputs for NERDSS.
    - **1utc** : Seems to be an example of using IoNERDSS for editing PDB files and creating files to be input into NERDSS. However, the code is seperate from the library, and just .py files here. 
    - **raw_functions:** Same as 1utc but only includes the functions.
    - 3Dtest.py: Unknown.
    - JupyterNotebook: Instantiates IoNERDSS functions and uses them for various PDB related tasks.
    - 1si4/1utc: NERDSS output.
 - **PlatonicSolids:** Examples of creating platonic solids using IoNERDSS.
    - Folders with solid names (ex: Cube, Octahedron).
        - **[name]Face** and **[name]Vertex:** the two files have slightly different contents in each file, but I do not know the difference.
            - [name].mole / parm.inp: inputs for NERDSS made by IoNERDSS.
            - JupyterNotebook: Creates the inputs for NERDSS (instanstiates all functions, does not import).
    - **PyFilesForPlatonicSolids:** Includes python files that instantiate functions that can be used to create Platoic Solids that can be inputted in NERDSS. However, the scripts will not create any platonic solids as they only instantiate the functions, maybe intended for user to add their own code at the bottom.
    - **Clath_rotate:** Includes 1 JupyterNotebook that instantiates and then runs functions that rotates clathrin (the initial clathrin data is included in the script).
